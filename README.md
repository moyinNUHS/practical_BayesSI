# practical

All codes for simulation, analysis and plots are found in the `Code` folder. 

# `Code` folder 

This folder includes the following.

## `run_scenarios.R`

This R file runs the various scenarios and saves outputs in the `Code/Run_outputs` folder. 

## `plot_scenarios.Rmd` 

This Rmd file plots the outputs loaded from the `Code/Run_outputs` folder.

## `plot_all.R` 

This R file plots the figures for our manuscript using the outputs loaded from the `Code/Run_outputs` folder.

## `Functions` folder 

This folder contains all functions used for simulation, analysis and plots. 

The key function is the `simulation.R` function which creates simulated data and performs the analysis.

## `Archive` folder

This folder contains previous functions, plots, results and output, which are no longer  relevant.

## ` hpc` folder

This folder contains R scripts which have been used to run the simulation on the NUS high performance cluster.

# `Plots` folder 

This folder contains all plots.

# `Published materials` folder
